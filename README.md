# Assignment3_CS6360

As a note we have only tested this via the Game view from the unity Editor and 
not on the actual headsets, it should work though as far as we can tell.

There are three separate scenes for our unity project. While in game,
the user can press the following keyboard buttons to toggle scenes:

b = "bloom scene"
d = "depth-of-field rendering scene"
f = "Fix Foveated Rendering Scene"

While in the Fix Foveated Rendering Scene the user can toggle between low
and medium fix foveated rendering with the following keyboard buttons:

1 = "Low Fix Foveated Rendering"
2 = "Medium Fix Foveated Rendering"

We have both contributed to this code in an equitable manner and agree that, to the best of our knowledge,
it accurately represents our understanding for the assignment.
