# Assignment3_CS6360

As a note, the bloom and depth of field rendering both work with a VR headset.
The FFR works in game as long as we don't make the project VR compatible. We
are unsure of what went wrong there. Nevertheless the effect does work on the 
rendered unity Scene and Game view portals. 

There are three separate scenes for our unity project. While in game,
the user can press the following keyboard buttons to toggle scenes:

b = "bloom scene"
d = "depth-of-field rendering scene"
f = "Fix Foveated Rendering Scene"

The user can toggle between low and medium FFR by selecting the "High FFR"
checkbox under the FFR script which is associated with the Main Camera object.

We have both contributed to this code in an equitable manner and agree that, to the best of our knowledge,
it accurately represents our understanding for the assignment.
